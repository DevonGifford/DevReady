# Database Schema Documentation

## Overview

The ZTMReady application relies on a Firebase Firestore NoSQL database to store and manage data. The database is designed to efficiently organize and retrieve information related to user profiles, quiz questions, and quiz sets. This documentation provides an in-depth exploration of the two main collections within the database: `users` and `questions`.

## Database Interaction

### Reading Data

Data can be retrieved from the database by querying the respective collections using the Firebase Firestore API. Users can retrieve their profile information, quiz sets, and questions based on the provided unique identifiers.

### Writing Data

To update information, users can modify their user document or submit new quiz sets/questions, which will be added to the appropriate collections. Firebase Firestore automatically generates unique identifiers for new documents.

## Conclusion

Understanding the structure and relationships within the ZTMReady database is crucial for effective data management and application functionality. Whether you are a developer, contributor, or simply curious about the inner workings of ZTMReady, this documentation serves as a valuable resource for navigating the database schema.
