# How to Open a Pull Requests

These instructions guide you through the process of contributing code changes to ZTMReady through pull requests. Follow these steps to set up your development environment, create branches, make changes, and submit pull requests.

## Prologue: Getting Ready

Before contributing, ensure that you have the necessary tools and dependencies installed. You can find guidance in the [Environment Setup](#) section. Additionally, to accept your pull request, submit a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](#). Complete this once to contribute to any of ZTMReady's open-source projects.

## Chapter I: Welcome to Open Source

### 1. Install `git`

Ensure that you have `git` installed on your machine. Follow [GitHub's instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) for the setup.

### 2. Get the source code

Fork the ZTMReady repository on GitHub to your account. Clone your fork to your local machine using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/ZTMReady.git
git remote add fork https://github.com/your_username/ZTMReady.git
```

This creates a local clone with remotes set up for the upstream ZTMReady repository (`origin`) and your fork (`fork`).

### 3. Create a branch

Create a new branch to track your changes:

```bash
git checkout --branch my_feature_branch --track origin/main
```

## Chapter II: Implementing your Changes

### 1. Make changes to the code

Use your preferred code editor to make necessary changes. Ensure changes adhere to coding conventions and guidelines.

### 2. Test your changes

Verify that your changes are correct and do not introduce test failures. Refer to [Running and Writing Tests](#) for detailed testing instructions.

### 3. Lint your code

Run linting tools (e.g., [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)) to ensure code styling consistency. Check code styling using `yarn run lint`.

### 4. View your changes

Use `git status` and `git diff` to keep track of code changes in your branch.

## Chapter III: Proposing your Changes

### 1. Commit your changes

Add and commit your changes to version control:

```bash
git add <filename>
git commit -m <message>
```

Provide a short, descriptive commit message.

### 2. Push your changes to GitHub

Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:

```bash
git push fork my_feature_branch
```

If successful, follow the provided URL to open a pull request.

### 3. Create your pull request

Fill out the pull request with a descriptive title, a summary of your motivation, and a test plan. Review and address feedback provided by maintainers.

You are on your way to making a meaningful contribution to ZTMReady! The maintainers will guide you through the review process to help get your changes ready for merging into the main repository.
