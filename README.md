# Ticket Handling Strategy

### Segmented Actionable Items:

#### 1. **Integration of React Form Library:**
   - [ ] Research and choose a suitable React form library (e.g., Formik, React Hook Form).
   - [ ] Integrate the selected library into the project structure.
   - [ ] Implement basic form structures for login and registration.

#### 2. **Utilize Zod for Validation:**
   - [ ] Integrate Zod library into the project.
   - [ ] Define validation schemas for login and registration fields.
   - [ ] Implement validation logic in forms to enforce schema.

#### 3. **Review and Analyze Existing Pages:**
   - [ ] Identify UI/UX issues, usability concerns, and potential areas for enhancement.
   - [ ] Document observations and propose changes for better user experience.

#### 4. **Implement Error Handling Mechanisms:**
   - [ ] Identify possible error scenarios (e.g., incorrect credentials, server errors).
   - [ ] Implement error messages and visual feedback for users.
   - [ ] Ensure error states are properly managed and communicated.

#### 5. **Refactor UI Components:**
   - [ ] Modify UI elements to accommodate new form structures and error handling.
   - [ ] Ensure consistency and alignment with design/UI team guidelines.
   - [ ] Update layout to match onboarding layout via `layout.tsx`.
   - [ ] Add a better background image to match onboarding styles.
   - [ ] Incorporate Framer Motion for enhanced animations.
   - [ ] Break forms up into header, form, and footer sections for reusability across pages.

#### 6. **User Profile Management Integration:**
   - [ ] Create functions to manage user documents within Firebase upon registration.
   - [ ] Connect user authentication with User Profile Context for data retrieval.
   - [ ] Implement error handling for user data retrieval and document creation.

### Considerations to Address:

1. **Documentation and Testing:**
   - [ ] Comprehensive documentation for integration steps, error handling mechanisms, and context implementation details.
   - [ ] Thorough testing covering various use cases, error scenarios, and CRUD operations within Firebase.

2. **Cross-Compatibility Testing:**
   - [ ] Ensure alignment and consistency with design/UI guidelines post-refactoring.
   - [ ] Test across browsers and devices for optimal performance and responsiveness.

4. **Future Reference and Maintenance:**
   - [ ] Prioritize detailed documentation for future maintenance and reference.
