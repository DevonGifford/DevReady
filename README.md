# **INTRODUCTION**:

This project is inspired by the style of ZTM, tailored to create an engaging quiz platform for ZTM students. Here's an overview of the envisioned features:

#### Initial Scope of Key Features:

- **Dynamic Flashcard Game**: Reinforce understanding of concepts and assess knowledge.
- **Adaptive Learning System**: Remember incorrect answers for future quizzes, providing targeted practice.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor advancement and achievements within the platform.
- **Intuitive Dashboard**: Enjoy a visually appealing and gamified experience while tracking progress.

#### List of Posible Future Ideas:

- **Collaborative Flashcard Database**: Fueled by community contributions. (Consider best practices for database management.)
- **Customizable Flashcard Sets**: Create and share sets within the community-driven database.
- **Course Recommendations**: Suggest ZTM courses based on user data - quizz results and onboarding info.
- **OpenAI Bot Integration**: Incorporate a trained OpenAI API bot for interactive interviews.

### **Project Goals**

This project serves two main purposes:

1. **Frontend Mastery**: Practice and refine frontend development skills.
2. **Development Best Practices**: Learn structuring, ordering, and planning for a seamless project workflow.

Moreover, this endeavor holds the potential to benefit others:

- **Tool for ZTM Students**: Serve as a valuable resource for ZTM students.
- **Open-Source Initiative**: Contribute as an open-source project for the broader ZTM community.

### Sub Goals:

- Explore a React Native version of the app after establishing the basic prototype.
- Implement Playwright for end-to-end testing, alongside robust unit and integration testing using Jest and RTL.
